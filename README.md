Internet Connection: Required to download the installation files.

Steps to Download and Install Visual Studio Code:
Download Visual Studio Code:

Open your preferred web browser and go to the Visual Studio Code download page.
Click on the "Download for Windows" button. This will download the VS Code installer for Windows.

Run the Installer:

Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file (usually in the "Downloads" folder) named something like VSCodeUserSetup-x64-<version>.exe.
Double-click the installer file to run it.

Installation Process:

When the installer starts, you will see a welcome screen. Click "Next" to continue.
Read and accept the license agreement, then click "Next".
Choose the destination folder where you want to install VS Code. The default path is usually fine, so you can just click "Next".
Select the additional tasks you would like the installer to perform:
You can create a desktop icon.
Add "Open with Code" action to the context menu (useful for quickly opening files/folders in VS Code).
Register VS Code as the default editor for supported file types.
Add to PATH (useful for running VS Code from the command line).
Click "Next" after selecting the additional tasks.
Click "Install" to begin the installation.
Complete the Installation:

Wait for the installation process to complete. It should only take a few minutes.
Once the installation is complete, you can choose to launch Visual Studio Code immediately by checking the "Launch Visual Studio Code" box.
Click "Finish" to close the installer.
Launch Visual Studio Code:

If you didn't select the "Launch Visual Studio Code" option during installation, you can open it by clicking the start menu, typing "Visual Studio Code", and selecting it from the list.
Alternatively, you can double-click the Visual Studio Code icon on your desktop if you created one.

2. First-time Setup:

Click on the View menu at the top of the screen.
Select Terminal from the dropdown menu.
Command Palette:

Press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) to open the Command Palette.
Type Toggle Integrated Terminal and select it from the list.
Using the Integrated Terminal
Basic Operations:

The terminal will open at the bottom of the VS Code window.
You can start typing commands just like you would in an external terminal.
To create a new terminal instance, click the plus (+) icon in the terminal tab bar or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+ (or Cmd+Shift+ on macOS).
To switch between multiple terminal instances, click the dropdown arrow next to the plus icon and select the desired terminal from the list.
Customizing the Terminal:

You can adjust terminal appearance settings such as font size and cursor style by searching for terminal.integrated in the settings.
Terminal Tasks:

You can run tasks defined in your workspace's tasks.json file by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B (or Cmd+Shift+B on macOS) or selecting Run Task from the Terminal menu.
Advantages of Using the Integrated Terminal Compared to an External Terminal
Convenience:

The integrated terminal is embedded within the VS Code interface, allowing you to execute commands without leaving the editor. This seamless integration can significantly streamline your workflow.
Workspace Context:

The integrated terminal automatically opens in the context of your current workspace, so you don't need to navigate to your project directory manually.
Multi-tasking:

You can have multiple terminal instances open simultaneously, each in a separate tab. This is particularly useful for running various scripts, servers, or command-line tools side by side.
Synchronization with the Editor:

The terminal can interact directly with the VS Code editor, allowing you to run commands and see their effects on your code in real-time. For instance, running a build or test command in the terminal can highlight errors directly in the editor.
Integrated Experience:

Features like command history, auto-completion, and shell integration are available within the integrated terminal, providing a consistent development environment.
Customization and Extensibility:

You can customize the terminal to match your preferences, such as changing the shell, adjusting the appearance, or installing terminal-related extensions. This level of customization is often more straightforward than configuring an external terminal.
Resource Management:

Using the integrated terminal can be more resource-efficient since it runs within the VS Code process, reducing the overhead of running separate terminal applications.

9. Debugging in VS Code:

   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
   Steps to Set Up and Start Debugging in VS Code
Install VS Code:

Download and install VS Code from the official website.
Install Necessary Extensions:

Open VS Code and go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
Search for and install relevant extensions for the programming language you are using (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++).
Open or Create a Project:

Open your project folder in VS Code by selecting File > Open Folder... and choosing the directory of your project.
Alternatively, create a new folder for your project and open it in VS Code.
Create a Source Code File:

Create a new file for your source code (e.g., main.py for Python, app.js for JavaScript) by selecting File > New File and saving it with the appropriate extension.
Write or paste your code into this file.
Configure the Debugger:

Click on the Run icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or press Ctrl+Shift+D to open the Run and Debug view.
Click on create a launch.json file link to create a configuration file.
Choose the environment that matches your project (e.g., Python, Node.js).
VS Code will generate a basic launch.json configuration file. Customize it as needed for your project.
Set Breakpoints:

Click in the gutter to the left of the line numbers in your code file to set breakpoints. A red dot will appear to indicate a breakpoint.
Start Debugging:

Click the green play button (Start Debugging) at the top of the Run and Debug view or press F5.
The debugger will start, and your program will run. Execution will pause at any breakpoints you have set.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code
Breakpoints:

Set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to a line number. You can also set conditional breakpoints that only trigger under certain conditions.
Step Over/Into/Out:

Control the execution flow using the step controls:
Step Over (F10): Move to the next line of code, skipping over function calls.
Step Into (F11): Move into the function call.
Step Out (Shift+F11): Step out of the current function.
Variable Watch:

Watch specific variables to see how their values change during execution. Add variables to the watch list in the VARIABLES pane.
Call Stack:

View the call stack to see the sequence of function calls that led to the current point of execution. This is useful for understanding how you arrived at a particular state in your program.
Debug Console:

Evaluate expressions and execute commands in the context of the paused program. Access this via the Debug Console pane.
Exception Handling:

Configure the debugger to break when exceptions are thrown, even if they are caught later. This can help identify the source of runtime errors.
Conditional Breakpoints:

Set breakpoints that only trigger when a specified condition is true. Right-click on a breakpoint and select “Edit Breakpoint” to set a condition.
Logpoints:

Instead of stopping at a breakpoint, logpoints allow you to log a message to the console when a certain line is executed, which is useful for debugging without interrupting program flow.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

 Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide screenshots or step-by-step instructions where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by 1st July
